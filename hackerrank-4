#now in this problem we have to devide two numbers and also have to perform modulus function...

#to do so we have to import a module named __future__ and in this module we have to import a function name division

# so lets start .....


from __future__ import division

raunak=int(raw_input())
garg = int(raw_input())

print raunak/garg                   //output = divide
print raunak//garg                 //output = modules
