#here what you have to do..is to take input from user and print the values of square of values from range 0 to that number

# first of all take an example with for loop


raunak = int(raw_input())
for i in range(0,raunak)
print i*i



# by while loop

raunak = int(raw_input())

i=0
while(i<5)
  print i*i
  i=+1
